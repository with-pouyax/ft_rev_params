This repository houses a C program crafted to print all command-line arguments it receives in reverse order, starting from the last argument to the first. This utility can be particularly instructive for those learning about command-line argument handling and array manipulation in C.

## Program Description

Upon execution, the program iterates over the command-line arguments in reverse, leveraging a decrementing loop to traverse the `argv` array from the end to the start. This demonstrates an essential technique for reverse iteration over arrays in C programming.

### Key Features

- Skips the program's name and directly processes user-provided arguments.
- Prints each argument on a new line for clear readability.
- Utilizes the `write` system call for output, showcasing low-level I/O operations in C.
